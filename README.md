# Nano-Kiln_control
This project is made to control the state of the air valve on the electrics kilns, Rhode in my case. this is a simple and easy project who uses the MAX31856 thermocouple interface. This choice is because of the sensor is an S thermocouple. the probe wiring ha to be made with the right kind of compensated cable, orange cable using the S TC, but it can be wired in parallel with the actual kiln connection without making interference with the temperature regulator.
in the sketch is possible to change the switching point, that is when the valve have to close, changing the SetPoint value, actually setted to 650Â° C.
the process is delayed because is possible to use a battery as supply. In this case is possible make longer the waiting time reducing the current cosumption. in the progetct is 5000 ms.
